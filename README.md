# Predicting Surplus Energy for Renewable Energy Services

## Project Description
In the face of escalating energy prices and growing concerns about climate change, the need for sustainable energy solutions has never been more urgent. This project endeavors to address these challenges by developing a predictive model to forecast surplus energy availability, specifically focusing on wind and solar energy sources.
The company, operating in the energy sector, seeks to provide a novel service to its customers residing in Bringhton, an area known for its ample renewable energy resources. By leveraging historical energy records and advanced predictive modeling techniques, the company aims to offer free energy services to local customers when there is an excess of renewable energy in their vicinity. This initiative not only promotes the utilization of clean energy but also provides tangible benefits to consumers in the form of reduced energy costs.

### Environment Setup:
1. Python Installation: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. 
2. Package Installation: 
os
pandas
matplotlib
numpy
seaborn

#### Running the Code:
1. Dataset Download: Download the provided dataset ('combined_file') and place it in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Notebook Execution: Open the Jupyter Notebook file (Momna_2312484.ipynb) in your Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Execute Cells: Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to load the dataset, explore data, clean, preprocess, and build the predictive model.

##### Assumptions:
1. Energy Sources: The surplus of energy is primarily determined based on wind and solar energy production levels.
2. Catchment Area: The analysis focuses on Brighton  as the primary catchment area.
3. Weather Conditions: Assumptions are made regarding typical weather patterns and environmental factors influencing renewable energy production in the area.
